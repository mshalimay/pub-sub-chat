I tested part4 by running 5 different command lines

1) Navigate to the part4 folder

2) Open CMD 1 and run:
 python mc_server.py 0.0.0.0 9000 9001

This will deploy the multichannel server, listening to messages in port 9000 and publishing messages in port 9001


3) Open CMD 2 and run:
 python3 mc_client.py 0.0.0.0 9000 9001 all moises

This will launch a client that listen to all channels, but is unable to send messages.


4) Open CMD 3 and run:

 python3 mc_client.py 0.0.0.0 9000 9001 sports amanda

This will launch a client that listen and send messages to the 'sports' channel


5) Open CMD 4 and run:

 python3 mc_client.py 0.0.0.0 9000 9001 sports chard

This will launch another client that listen and send messages to the 'sports' channel


6) Open CMD 5 and run:

 python3 mc_client.py 0.0.0.0 9000 9001 news john

This will launch aclient that listen and send messages to the 'news' channel

Now to test the functionality:
1) Send a "hi" using CMD 3 and "hello" using CMD 4. You should see both messages in both consoles AND in CMD2 (the "all" channel) 
but not in CMD 5, since this client only listen to 'news' channel

2) Send "world" using CMD 5. You should see "world" in CMD5 and CMD2 (the "all" channel), but not in CMD 3 and 4,
since these clients only listen to 'sports' channel

3) Try sending a message using CMD 2. You should see no message in none of the consoles, since this client signed for all channels and is read-only
